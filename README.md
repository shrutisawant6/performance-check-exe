We often find ourselves uncertain about whether a process within our operating system, is responsible for performance issues. 
As a result, we tend to explore numerous tools, leading to a shaky conclusion.

To address this, have created a simple executable that provides performance checks and resource utilization for a specific process. 
And the best part is, you need **less than a minute to obtain the results !**

Give it a try!
